<h4 id="riot-handling-data">Handling data</h4>

By default, Riot.js passes all primitive data (strings, numbers, booleans) to Custom Elements as attributes. It passes complex data (Objects, Arrays) to Custom Elements as properties.

<h4 id="riot-handling-events">Handling events</h4>

Riot.js can listen to native DOM events dispatched from Custom Elements. It supports
all styles of events (lowercase, camelCase, kebab-case, etc).
